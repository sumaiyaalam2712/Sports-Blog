                                and heartfelt, then it was the final time Steph Curry and Klay Thompson splashed
                                together.</span>
                            <span class="post-devider">They are basketball brothers no more, with Thompson ending a
                                partnership that produced four championships with the Warriors and multitudes of
                                historic memories that enhanced the game.</span>

                                decision that served as an escape from a recent Warriors past that frustrated him. But
                                that decision also affected Curry, who finally had a chance to speak publicly Sunday
                                about what it all meant — and means.
                            </span>
                            <span class="post-devider">Curry took a break from Olympic preparations with Team USA to

                            <span class="post-devider">Curry and Thompson were together since 2011, sharing the same
                                jersey but more importantly the same enviable skill — shooting from distance — that
                                defined them as a duo. They’re the only teammates to combine for more than 600
                                3-pointers in a season (678 in 2015-16) and took turns competing with each other for
                                3-point feats. In 2018, Thompson made 14 from deep to beat Curry’s single-game record by
                                one.
                            </span>

                                But it went beyond that. Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green defined the Warriors’
                                championship dynasty, and Curry perhaps naively thought they’d be attached forever,
                                especially after Green signed an extension two summers ago.

                                Thompson was clearly unhappy and fretted not only over the season, but his future.
                                Negotiations with the Warriors weren’t smooth. Thompson, searching for a new start,
                                chose the new Western Conference champion Mavericks over the Lakers despite a plea from
                                LeBron James.

                                A lesser breakup, but still a significant one for the Clippers, happened when Paul
                                George left via free agency for the Philadelphia 76ers. Unlike the Splash Brothers,
                                George and Kawhi Leonard had no championships to show for their partnership, which began
